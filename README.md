# Restaurant Reservation App - Periodic Tables #

## Project Description: ##

The Restaurant Reservation App provides restaurant managers with an easy and effective way to track and manage reservations.

Some important features include:

1. A dashboard on the homepage lists reservations for the current date and displays a list of tables in the restaurant. The manager can also navigate forward and backward to look at reservations from the previous day and for the next day.
